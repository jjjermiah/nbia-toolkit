    Parse the target pattern to create a format string with named placeholders
    and extract a list of DICOM keys.

    The target pattern is a string with placeholders matching '%<DICOMKey>'.
    This method converts placeholders into a format string with named placeholders
    and creates a list of DICOM keys contained within the placeholders.

    Returns:
        Tuple[str, List[str]]: A tuple containing the format string and a list of DICOM keys.
